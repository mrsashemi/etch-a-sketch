            <p class="portalconcept">Portal is a real-world ineractive, glowing work of art created by Hasib Hashemi 
                and Adeeb Djaward of WizardsRobbingKids. The piece was created
                using epoxy resin and is actually two different images with a two way
                mirror in-between. Depending on the level of light hitting the painting, a different image is
                shown.</p>
            <p class="project">Using scans of the original art piece, I adapted this Javascript 
                etch-a-sketch project into a digital demonstration of the piece itself. 
                Use the above slider to adjust the grid dimensions or to reset.</p>

            <p class="portalexplanation">This slider represents the lighting and adjust the opacity of the image 
                to reveal the image below. You'll notice the sketch effect changes as 
                the opacity is adjusted. Under 50% and the etch-a-sketch will change completely.
                Depending on the light, you begin to see both images simultaneously.</p>
            <p class="changelightexplain">During the day, portal is a mirror with a 3D pattern transparently
                oil painted over the top of it. The primary colors are glazed over 
                layers of clear epoxy resin. Holographic film is used in place of 
                paint over one side of the pattern. As light travels through top 
                layers, it bounces off the mirror reflecting the viewer and the hologram
                If the lighting is just right, the piece reflects a rainbow.</p>
